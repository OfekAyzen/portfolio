        <p>
          I’m a 25-year-old full-stack developer with experience in both
          front-end and back-end technologies. On the front end, I work with
          HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, and Vue.js.
          On the back end, I specialize in AWS, MongoDB, Express, and MySQL.
          Beyond software, I have a strong background in computer hardware and
          electronics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a quick learner, fluent in Hebrew and English, and passionate
          about gaming, technology, and continuous growth as a developer.
